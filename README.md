# HideAllDots10

!! Heavily based on https://github.com/harrywantstodev/NoDots10 !!

Modified version of harrywantstodev's NoDots10. I used NoDots10 on a lot of my legacy devices, but was annoyed by a Cephei warning that would appear after respringing.

Officially supports iOS 10, although it should(?) work from iOS 7-iOS 14, at least partially. YMMV.

This version of NoDots10 removes Cephei entirely. Due to this, there are no options to configure.
